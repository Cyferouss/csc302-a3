# Diagnosis
The specific bug that I have chosen to work on is a DevTools Inspector bug. Specifically, the issue that is currently occurring is a flag in the inspector which shows a certain CSS element, 'grid-gap', as having no effect on the container, when it actually does.

The scope of the bug is relatively small, but location of the bug creates larger implications. Namely, this is a bug that is present in the Inspector tool of Mozilla, a tool that is widely employed in all manners of web-development for applications and websites. A bug with a debugging tool such as this can cause greater misunderstanding when developers are attempting to use it to debug their own applications, and as a result this is an important bug to address as soon as possible.

# Solution
As mentioned by Patrick Brosset (:pbro), my mentor for this bug, the fix is relatively minor. The issue lies within the invalid-property-helper.js file specifying which properties cannot be applied to what classes of elements. In this particular instance, 'grid-gap' is a legacy shorthand that CAN be applied to flex containers.

Specifically, the fix is to move the 'grid-gap' invalid property from non-flex containers, to being one of both non-grid AND non-flex containers. However upon further insight from another contributor, ExE boss, we have discovered two other legacy shorthands, 'grid-column-gap' and 'grid-row-gap' that must also be addressed as invalid properties of non-flex, non-grid and non-multi-col containers.

# Testing
The bug reporter, Brian Birtles (:birtles) has attached a helpful (and self-contained) test case/file in which the Inspector error occurs.

Besides the automated testing done by the Mozilla codebase, this file will be used to validate the proper functionality of the patch and resolution of the bug.

Since this is a current bug with the live version of Mozilla Firefox, opening the test file in the live Firefox browser will serve as our control case, while the test file opened in the local Nightly developer browser will serve as our actual test.

The images showing the before and after of the patch application are provided alongside this .md file.
